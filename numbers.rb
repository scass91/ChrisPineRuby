#A Few Things to Try
#Write a program which tells you:
#how many hours are in a year?
puts 24*365
#how many minutes are in a decade?
puts 60*24*3650
#how many seconds old are you?
puts 27.5 * 365 * 24 * 60 * 60
#how many chocolates do you hope to eat in your life?
#Warning: This part of the program could take a while to compute!
puts "All of it"

#Here's a tougher question:
#If I am 1298 million seconds old, how old am I?
puts 1298000000 / 60 / 60 / 24 / 365
